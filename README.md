# [Spotify Portal](http://www.sergprieto.codes)  - Share your favorite songs from Spotify

Simple site to share Spotify songs via the blockchain. Created with Typescript, EthersJS, ReactJS for the frontend. Solidity and HardHat used to develop the backend.

# Introduction

As a small first project after completing my [capstone project](https://github.com/akclifto/Retrospective_Toolkit), I wanted to reinforce my front-end skills by using Typescript and ReactJS. I chose to utilize the blockchain as the project's backend to understand different programming paradigms and broaden my knowledge as a web developer. 

# Technologies 

Proeject is created with: 

- React 17
- Typescript 4.1
- MetaMask 1
- EthersJS 5.4
- Jest 26
- Solidity 0.8
- HardHat 2.6

# Setup

To run this project, use the main site: [http://www.sergprieto.codes](http://www.sergprieto.codes)

>**To post a song link, the MetaMask browser extension must be installed. This extension will provide the browser with a wallet's public information to be used by the application.**

The project can also be run locally on localhost:3000 using yarn:
```bash
$ cd spotify-portal/
$ yarn
$ yarn start
```
# Inspiration

This project was intially based on a tutorial on [buildspace](buildspace.so).

# Future Steps
- Add more elegant error handling to sending a song link.
- Improve UX to viewing the Song list.
- Add loading animation when sending a new song via the blockchain.
